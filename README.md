# Breadcrumbs

Welcome to the Breadcrumbs project! This initiative is focused on enhancing the user navigation experience on our library.austintexas.gov website. We are creating intuitive and efficient breadcrumbs for each of our content types and taxonomy terms.

## Project Structure
Each content type and taxonomy term within our project has its own dedicated directory. These directories serve as repositories for examples and configuration files pertinent to the breadcrumb implementation for that specific type or term.

## Design Guidelines
For the design and implementation of breadcrumbs, we are following the guidance provided by the U.S. Web Design System. More details about these guidelines can be found here: [U.S. Web Design System - Breadcrumb](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/breadcrumb/).

## Contribution
We encourage contributors to add examples, suggest improvements, and help refine our breadcrumb configurations. Your input is valuable in making this project a success!
